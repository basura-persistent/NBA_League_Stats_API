# NBA_League_Stats_API

Motivation: Any sports team has upper management looking to query performance data about their players but with no SQL skills this is difficult. 

 This demo API service allows users who may not be familiar with sql to pull data to the terminal via curl request.
 
 ***Please update connector.js file with your own SQL db info***
 
 **Please update your own API key as well**
